## Challenges Faced & How We Resolved Them
1Ô∏è‚É£ **OAuth Integration Delays**  
   - Initially faced issues in setting up **Google & Facebook login**.  
   - **Solution:** Used **Passport.js** and debugged API redirections.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Security Question Verification Issues**  
   - Issue: The security answer stored was **hashed**, and direct comparison failed.  
   - **Solution:** Implemented **bcrypt.compare()** for correct validation.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Password Reset Token Expiry & Handling**  
   - Initially, **tokens were not invalidating** after use.  
   - **Solution:** Implemented **token expiration & auto-removal after reset**.  

*"Despite these challenges, we managed to overcome them and improve our authentication flow."*
