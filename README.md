## **üé§ Opening Statement**
**You:**  
*"Hello everyone, welcome to the Sprint Review for our Learning Management System (LMS) backend. I will walk you through the progress we made in this sprint, including what we achieved, challenges we faced, and what‚Äôs planned next."*

---

## **üìå 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sprint Goal Recap**
**You:**  
*"Our primary goal in this sprint was to complete the authentication and security features for the LMS backend. This included implementing user authentication, password reset functionalities, and securing our API endpoints. Additionally, we aimed to introduce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security."*

---

## **‚úÖ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Completed Work & Achievements**
**You:**  
*"We successfully implemented the following features:"*

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Authentication**
   - **JWT-based authentication** for login and registration.  
   - Users receive a **secure token** upon login.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **OAuth Login**
   - Integrated **Google & Facebook login** using **Passport.js**.  
   - Allows users to log in without needing a password.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Implemented **role-based permissions** for **Student, Instructor, and Admin**.  
   - Ensures **restricted access** to specific functionalities.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Security Questions for Password Reset**
   - Users **set up a security question & answer** during registration.  
   - Required before **resetting a password**.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Password Reset via Link & OTP**
   - Users can reset their password using a **reset link** sent via email.  
   - **OTP-based password reset** (email verification).  

6Ô∏è‚É£ **API Security Enhancements**
   - Implemented **authentication middleware** to **protect routes**.  
   - Added **error handling & validation** for API requests.  

*"All these implementations make our backend secure and user-friendly."*

---

## **üî• 3Ô∏è‚É£ Demo of Implemented Features**
**You:**  
*"Now, I will walk you through a quick demonstration of our backend functionalities."*

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Register & Login Demo**  
   - Show how a **new user registers** using Postman.  
   - Log in with the newly created account and get a **JWT token**.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **OAuth Login Demo**  
   - Show **Google/Facebook authentication** flow.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Protected Route Demo**  
   - Attempt to **access a restricted route** without a token (should fail).  
   - Provide a valid token and **access granted** (successful response).  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Password Reset Flow**  
   - Show a user requesting **password reset via security question**.  
   - Validate the security answer and **receive a reset token**.  
   - Successfully **reset password using the token**.  

*"This demonstrates that all the core authentication features are working as expected."*

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è 4Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges Faced & How We Resolved Them**
**You:**  
*"We encountered a few challenges during the sprint, but we successfully resolved them. Here are some key ones:"*

1Ô∏è‚É£ **OAuth Integration Delays**  
   - Initially faced issues in setting up **Google & Facebook login**.  
   - **Solution:** Used **Passport.js** and debugged API redirections.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Security Question Verification Issues**  
   - Issue: The security answer stored was **hashed**, and direct comparison failed.  
   - **Solution:** Implemented **bcrypt.compare()** for correct validation.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Password Reset Token Expiry & Handling**  
   - Initially, **tokens were not invalidating** after use.  
   - **Solution:** Implemented **token expiration & auto-removal after reset**.  

*"Despite these challenges, we managed to overcome them and improve our authentication flow."*

---

## **üöß 5Ô∏è‚É£ Pending Items & Blockers**
**You:**  
*"While we accomplished most of the planned features, a few tasks are still pending and will be carried over to the next sprint."*

| **Pending Feature** | **Reason for Delay** | **Next Steps** |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Duo MFA Implementation** | Still researching best integration approach | Will be implemented next sprint. |
| **PostgreSQL Database Integration** | Another team member is handling it | Awaiting database setup. |

*"We are prioritizing these tasks in the upcoming sprint."*

---

## **üîú 6Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps & Sprint Planning**
**You:**  
*"Looking ahead, the next sprint will focus on improving security and scalability. Our key priorities include:"*

‚úÖ **Implementing Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   - Require **Duo push notification or OTP verification** before login.  
   - Protect sensitive actions with **step-up authentication**.  

‚úÖ **Migrating from JSON storage to PostgreSQL**  
   - Move user data from **temporary JSON files** to **PostgreSQL database**.  
   - Ensure **scalability and long-term data persistence**.  

‚úÖ **Enhancing API Security**  
   - Implement **rate limiting & monitoring** for API endpoints.  
   - Add **logging & alerts** for suspicious login attempts.  

*"Completing these will significantly enhance the security and performance of our LMS backend."*

---

## **üéØ Closing Statement**
**You:**  
*"To summarize, we have successfully built a secure and functional authentication system with JWT, OAuth, and security-based password recovery. Moving forward, we will enhance security with Duo MFA and database integration."*  

*"Thank you all for your time! I‚Äôm open to any questions or feedback."*

---

### **üí° Final Touches**
- ‚úÖ Be **clear & concise** in your explanations.  
- ‚úÖ Keep **Postman ready** for the live demo.  
- ‚úÖ If asked about a blocker, explain how it will be resolved.  
- ‚úÖ End with a **strong summary & next steps**.
